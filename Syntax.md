# Lambdas
+ I really like the curly brace lambda syntax as in Koka or Swift.
	- It interacts quite nicely with the function application syntax as you don't need a special "trailing lambda" case.
+ I'm not so sure about including the arguments inside the braces.

# Dot Syntax
+ Beautifully unifies the struct accessor with projection function dilemma

# Definitions
+ Type annotation
+ Name only once
+ Separate variable and function syntax
